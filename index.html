          </div>
          <p class="mx-auto">In this build breakdown I will be talking about the hardware that is currently in
            my PC and why I chose them. But here's a little background story on how it came to be.
            It's october of 2020. Just 8 months after the world changing event of the COVID-19
            outbreak. Everyone is stuck at home quarantining but with so much time on my hands I
            decided to explore some new hobbies and that's when I came across the world of building
            PC's. Before I could even think about building my own PC, I needed to learn and understand
            how a PC works. A popular Reddit community by the name of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/">
              r/pcmasterrace </a>
            and a handful of Youtubers are what made me a master of PC's in just 2 weeks. My two biggest
            problems at the time were the scarcity of computer parts and the absoult insane price markup on
            the ones that weren't sold out. But I prevailed and managed to get greats deals on my specs.
            Now enough talking, let's dive right into it!</p>

            It's a couple years old and I am able to stream games at max settings as well as render video.
            It stays pretty cool and is worth the money. I don't see myself needing to upgrade anytime soon.</p>

            heat away
            from your hardworking CPU. Without it, your CPU will overheat. I decided to go with the Wraith Stealth
            cooler which already comes in the box. It does exactly what it needs to do and does a great job keeping
            the CPU temperature low. I don't <a

            computer are connected
            to the motherboard.This lets them work together. Your CPU sits in the motherboard and all your external
            peripherals (Keyboard,Mouse,Ethetnet) connect. This motherboard has an AM4 socket which is compatible to
            Ryzen 5000, 3rd/2nd/1st Gen AMD Ryzen CPUs. I liked that it had two HDMI ports as well as a numch of USB
            ports.
            It also runs pretty fast. My only regret would be that it didn't come with in board WIFI.</p>

            It comes with 2 in the box. Each stick is 8gb. I personally only selected it because of the RGB. But its
            good for
            the price and runs fast.</p>

          <p class="mx-auto">Storage gives a computer the ability to retain data such as documents, photos, videos etc.
            I have two different forms
            of storage for my computer. The first one being the Seagate Barracuda external hard drive. I purposely chose
            for it to
            have 2TB because I knew Id be downloading a lot of games, apps and photos. I think its a great hard drive
            for the amount
            of storage and the price. It also runs fast. My second form of storage is the WD Blue SN550 SSD. This
            storage sits on the
            motherboard and has 500gb. The SSD is much quicker than the external hard drive. I only have my OS and a
            couple huge games
            that are normally known to take a while to load.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="mx-auto">The graphics card is what sends a video signal to your display. At the time of the
            pandemic, it was super hard to get the
            new 30 series card or any card for that matter because building a computer became a trend. And because it
            was so popular,
            everyone was buying everything, and prices were through the roof because of all the demand and very little
            product available.
            I chose the 2060 Super because I was looking for something that wouldnt phase out and would last a long time
            before needing an
            upgrade. I also wanted something super reliable because if I needed to have it replaced that would be a
            problem. The 2060 Super
            has 8gb of GDDR6 RAM and it still puts out a great picture when playing AAA games.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="mx-auto">The case is the unit that holds all the computers components in one place. The H510 is a
            mid-tower case.
            I bought it for aesthetic purposes, but the downside is the lack of ventilation in the case. Down the road
            I will probably end up switching cases for the sake of keeping all my components cooled. Other than that,
            its a wonderful case for the price.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="mx-auto">The power supply is what gives the whole computer life, it supplies power to everything.
            When I was first
            learning about computer components. One piece of advice for power supplies was to never cheap out on them
            because a bad one could fry your whole system and even catch on fire. I did a bunch of research and I kept
            coming back to Corsair for a good power supply brand. So, I got a 750 watt 80 plus gold power supply.
            Its very good for the price, quiet and has more than enough power.</p>
